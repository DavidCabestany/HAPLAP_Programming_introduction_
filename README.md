# Introduction to Python Programming for NLP

Welcome to the "Introduction to Python Programming for NLP" repository! This repository contains my solutions for the course that introduces the basics of Python programming specifically tailored for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

## Course Description

The course is designed to provide an entry point for individuals interested in NLP but with limited or no prior experience in Python. Python is a versatile and widely used programming language in the field of NLP due to its simplicity, readability, and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools. This course will focus on the essential Python concepts and how they apply to NLP tasks.

## Syllabus

The course covers the following topics:

1. **Introduction to Python**: Getting started with Python, installing Python and Jupyter Notebook, understanding Python syntax, data types, variables, and basic operations.

2. **Working with Strings and Text**: Exploring string manipulation in Python, handling text data, and common operations for text processing.

3. **Data Structures**: Understanding Python data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, and how they are used in NLP.

4. **Control Flow and Loops**: Mastering conditional statements and loops to control the flow of your NLP programs.

5. **Functions**: Learning how to define and use functions in Python for better code organization and reusability in NLP tasks.

6. **File Handling**: Reading and writing files in Python, particularly useful when dealing with large text corpora.

7. **Introduction to NLP Libraries**: Exploring popular NLP libraries in Python, such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and spaCy.

8. **Text Preprocessing**: Understanding the importance of text preprocessing in NLP and implementing tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization techniques.

## Assignments

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the assignments and practical tasks given during the course. Each assignment is organized into separate directories, and the solutions are provided in the form of Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or reports, as applicable.

## Note

These solutions represent my own work and are intended to serve as references and examples for fellow students. If you are currently enrolled in the same course, I encourage you to attempt the assignments independently before referring to these solutions.

## Disclaimer

While these solutions can aid your understanding of Python programming for NLP, please refrain from submitting them as your own work for grading purposes. Upholding academic integrity is of utmost importance.
